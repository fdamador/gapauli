# gapauli
A geometric algebra for Euclidean 3D space using the Pauli basis representation as a backend.

Two modules are provided:

GA20
GA30

Which implement GA(2,0) and GA(3,0) algebras respectively.  The first is implemented using only real Pauli matrixes
(\sigma_1, and \sigma_3), whereas the latter uses all three Pauli matrices.

FIXME: The .pdf help/demo file (a printout of testGA30.nb) references pauliGA, which has been renamed to GA30.
