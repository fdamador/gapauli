# gapauli
A geometric algebra Mathematica module for Euclidean 2D and 3D spaces using the Pauli basis representation as a backend, and a Mathematica module for STA (relativistic space with a +,-,-,- signature) using 

Three modules are provided:

* GA20
* GA30
* GA13

Which implement GA(2,0), GA(3,0), GA(1,3) algebras respectively.  The first is implemented using only real Pauli matrixes
(\sigma_1, and \sigma_3), the second uses all three Pauli matrices, and the last uses Dirac matrices.

FIXME: The .pdf help/demo file (a printout of testGA30.nb) references pauliGA, which has been renamed to GA30.
